Caching in Docker
In docker, if the lines have been executed before, 
the same lines if ran again will run faster due to the concept of caching.

In case somewhere in the middle a new line is added then till the new line
cache will be used and then everything after that line will be executed again.

----

For each line a new container is made and destroyed. That is the temporary container

----
Providing a custom name for the container

 //   docker build -t iamuv2000/mymongo:latest .

----
Node with docker!
//    COPY ./ ./ 
 This will copy all the contents of the directory to the container's working directory

 //    docker build -t iamuv2000/nodeapptest

 This will build the application and name the container as "iamuv2000/nodeapptest"

 //   docker run -p <my_port>:<container_port> iamuv2000/nodeapptest

Opening <my_port> to the <container_port>. Only <my_port> will now be able to access the 
container's <container_port>
